## Experience
### [OWT - Swisscom Digital Technology SA](https://www.owt.swiss/en/)
**Developer**

OWT is a strategy and technology consulting firm based in Switzerland supporting Swiss companies on their path towards digitalization.

##### Project with Swissgrid
I am working on modernizing the integration platform used by Swissgrid to connect their many applications to each others. 
This project is done hand-in-hand with integration engineers from Swissgrid, developers from OWT and site reliability engineers from GE Vernova.
I am involved in the new platform installation on Kubernetes, both on-premises and in the cloud (Azure).

`Kubernetes` `AKS` `Helm` `Docker` `Angular` `Terraform` `Kotlin` `PostgreSQL`

##### Project with Swisscom
I worked in a team (of four engineers) responsible for setting up an enterprise service bus and streamline communication within an air-gapped data center. I was involved in the definition and estimation of tasks for upcoming sprints during program increment (PI) planning. I sometimes presented the team's achievements at the end of the PI.

`OpenShift` `Docker` `Ansible` `Kafka` `NiFi`

##### Project with TelDaS
I implemented RESTful API endpoints to replace SSH file transfers with the support of a senior developer. I created, updated and decommissioned some stored procedures. Resolved bugs in both back-end and front-end found since the previous release.

`Java` `Spring Boot` `TypeScript` `Angular` `PL/SQL`

##### Certificates

### [IBM Research Zürich](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/) 
**Research Scientist**

I expanded the project I started during my Master thesis for which I work on interpretable machine learning.
I focused on a type of weakly supervised learning and investigated how well [attention weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) correlate with the ground truth importance pattern found in the datasets I constructed.

This work was presented at the 4th International Workshop on eXplainable Knowledge Discovery in Data Mining ([XKDD 2022](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/xkdd2022/)) and the respective article can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13018).

An updated version of the paper above was presented at the "All Things Attention" NeurIPS Workshop 2022 and can be found on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RuXGMxQjTO).

## Education
### [ETHZ](https://cbb.ethz.ch/) 
**Computational Biology and Bioinformatics MSc**

I developed my Computer Science skills and got introduced to the field of Artificial Intelligence while deepening my knowledge in Quantitative Biology. I applied what I learned on real-world problems during two short research projects before diving into the assesment of the attention mechanism as a source of explainability in Deep Learning during my Master thesis project at IBM Research.

### [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/education/bachelor-in-life-sciences-engineering/)
**Life Sciences Engineering BSc**

I acquired strong engineering and analytical skills. I made my way through calculus, I had my first encounter with object-oriented programming and I took active part in Life Sciences oriented laboratory experiments.

<br>

### [LTH](https://www.lth.se/utbildning/elektroteknik/)
**Exchange program**

I had the chance to discover a new country, improve my English skills and grow my social network. I took part in a wide range of lectures to complete my Bachelor, from Signal Processing to Biomechanics.

## Volunteer Experience

### [VIS VSETH](https://vis.ethz.ch/en/about/committees/ccbb)

**CCBB president**

As a committee, we organised social and career events to improve the life of students and help them benefit from the experience of others. Personally, I learned to lead and manage a small group of people, communicate with them as well as with other committees. I gained in organizational and budgeting skills.

### [Velove](https://veloveuzh.ch/)

**Active member and social ride organizer**

Velove is a student association built around a workshop where all students immatriculated in Zürich are offered access to all the tools they need to fix their bike. 
Sustainability and soft mobility are two major values shared between all the members. 
The active members take care of opening the workshop to other students twice a week throughout the semester, give bike related tips and gladly help people in their repairing project. 
In addition to that, I was in charge of organizing social rides and give the opportunity for people to meet and discover some new beautiful paths around the city.

### [JVAL Openair Festival](https://www.jval.ch/)

**Barman**

The JVAL Festival is "the most intimate Swiss festival" and welcomes around ten artists over three nights every summer in the vineyards overhanging Lake Geneva. I've been helping as a barman during the nights for a few years now. I also took over the vacant position of bar manager one summer and was responsible for a team of a dozen barman/maid and the coordination with the other responsible people and departments. I gave over that position because I felt someone living in the area throughout the year would be better suited to take part in the organisational meeting.
